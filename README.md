# AUDIOBOOK CREATOR

A Ruby terminal application that converts .pdf to .mp3 utilizing gems.

## WHAT I WANTED OUT OF THIS PROJECT
* Learn the fundamentals of ruby GEMS and how to utilize them.
* Use more than one gem so I learn how to intigrate multiple gems.
* Create a software program that I can later use to build on the rails framework and turn into a web based program.
* Create a program that I can use to reduce my growing list of books.
